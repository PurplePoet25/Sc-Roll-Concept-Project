**Project Name:** Sc-Roll: Student Attendance Management  
**Project Manager:** Gerald Monroe  
**Assistant Project Manager:** Hasan Bukhari  
**Client:** Professor Ujunwa Madububambachu, School of Computing, University of Southern Mississippi  
**Version:** 1.1  
**Issue Date:** 24/11/2024  
**Course:** ITC 371 - Information Technology Project Management

## Overview

Sc-Roll is an automated Student Attendance Management System developed for the University of Southern Mississippi. The system aims to streamline attendance tracking for professors, ensuring accurate, real-time records and significantly reducing the time spent on manual attendance tasks. This allows professors to focus more on teaching and student engagement, contributing to better academic outcomes and operational efficiency.

## Features

- **Automated Attendance Tracking:** Easily track student attendance in real-time with minimal manual intervention.
- **Accuracy:** Achieve an attendance tracking accuracy rate of at least 88%.
- **Time Efficiency:** Save professors up to 75% of time spent managing attendance.
- **Faculty Adoption:** Targeted faculty adoption rate of 85% for system use.
- **Seamless Integration:** Integrates smoothly with existing IT infrastructure at the University of Southern Mississippi.
- **Scalability & Security:** Built to scale and ensure data security as user numbers grow.

## Installation (Concept)

Since this is not a fully developed system yet, installation steps are not applicable. However, once development is initiated, the following steps will be considered for deployment:
1. **System Setup:** [Details on system installation will be provided here]
2. **User Access:** Faculty and administrative staff will be granted access based on permissions.
3. **Training:** A training module will be provided to faculty for smooth system adoption.

## Contributing

Contributions to this conceptual project are welcome, particularly in:
- Ideas for improving the proposed system functionality.
- Suggestions on how to overcome the anticipated risks and challenges.
- Helping to transition from concept to reality in future development phases.

If you'd like to contribute to this concept project, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

### Key Benefits:
- **Time Efficiency:** Saves professors valuable time by automating attendance tracking.
- **Data Accuracy:** Aims to achieve at least 88% accuracy in attendance records.
- **Faculty Adoption:** Encourages an 85% faculty adoption rate to ensure widespread usage.
- **Seamless Integration:** Conceptually integrates with existing systems and infrastructure at USM.
- **Scalability & Security:** Designed to be scalable and secure for university-wide usage.

## Features (Conceptualized)

- **Automated Attendance:** Automatically track students' attendance, reducing manual efforts.
- **Real-time Data:** Attendance data is available instantly for professors to access and use.
- **Reporting & Analytics:** Generate attendance reports with ease.
- **User-friendly Interface:** Easy-to-use interface for both professors and administrative staff.
- **Integration:** Designed to integrate seamlessly with the existing university IT systems.

## Project Goals
