# Sc-Roll: Concept Student Attendance Management System

**Project Name:** Sc-Roll: Student Attendance Management  
**Project Manager:** Gerald Monroe  
**Assistant Project Manager:** Hasan Bukhari  
**Client:** Professor Ujunwa Madububambachu, School of Computing, University of Southern Mississippi  
**Version:** 1.1  
**Issue Date:** 24/11/2024

## Overview

Sc-Roll is a **conceptualized** Student Attendance Management System designed for the University of Southern Mississippi. The objective of this project is to create a system that automates the process of tracking student attendance, which will help professors at USM save time, reduce administrative overhead, and improve the accuracy of attendance records. While the application is conceptual, it highlights the potential benefits for professors and students alike in terms of time efficiency, data accuracy, and overall academic improvement.

### Key Benefits:
- **Time Efficiency:** Saves professors valuable time by automating attendance tracking.
- **Data Accuracy:** Aims to achieve at least 88% accuracy in attendance records.
- **Faculty Adoption:** Encourages an 85% faculty adoption rate to ensure widespread usage.
- **Seamless Integration:** Conceptually integrates with existing systems and infrastructure at USM.
- **Scalability & Security:** Designed to be scalable and secure for university-wide usage.

## Features (Conceptualized)

- **Automated Attendance:** Automatically track students' attendance, reducing manual efforts.
- **Real-time Data:** Attendance data is available instantly for professors to access and use.
- **Reporting & Analytics:** Generate attendance reports with ease.
- **User-friendly Interface:** Easy-to-use interface for both professors and administrative staff.
- **Integration:** Designed to integrate seamlessly with the existing university IT systems.

## Project Goals

The Sc-Roll project aims to:
- Automate attendance tracking for professors at USM.
- Provide a scalable and secure system for future use.
- Improve the overall operational efficiency within the School of Computing.

## Deliverables

This is a concept application, meaning that:
- **No actual application** has been built yet, but this document outlines the proposed functionality, benefits, and goals.
- A **prototype** or working version is a future step once funding and approval are secured.

## Timeline (Concept)

Since this is a conceptualized project, the timeline consists of planning and design stages only:
- **Project Planning:** Completed on 24/11/2024.
- **Development Phase (Conceptual):** Future development phase dependent on approval.
- **Project Finalization:** Pending resource allocation and approval for full-scale development.

## Risks & Challenges

As this is a conceptualized project, the following risks are anticipated:

- **System Integration:** Conceptual integration with the university’s existing IT systems may present challenges during full-scale implementation.
- **Data Accuracy:** Ensuring high levels of attendance tracking accuracy during the initial rollout.

## Installation (Concept)

Since this is not a fully developed system yet, installation steps are not applicable. However, once development is initiated, the following steps will be considered for deployment:
1. **System Setup:** [Details on system installation will be provided here]
2. **User Access:** Faculty and administrative staff will be granted access based on permissions.
3. **Training:** A training module will be provided to faculty for smooth system adoption.
